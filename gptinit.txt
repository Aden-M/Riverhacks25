You want a block text version — simple, technical explanations, no fancy formatting, so another GPT instance (or program) can easily read it.

Here’s the clean block text version:

Project Structure and Strategy

The site uses Node.js with the Express framework to serve HTTP requests.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) is used for server-side rendering of HTML templates (.ejs files).

The /public directory is exposed statically. It contains CSS and client-side JavaScript files for each page to handle frontend behavior.

A new /resources directory is used to store static assets such as images (for example, logo.png). It is also exposed as static content via Express.

Each page in the site is backed by:

An .ejs template for the HTML structure.

A corresponding .js file in /public/js/ for dynamic frontend behavior (if needed).

Main routes are:

/map – serves the map page (Leaflet.js integration).

/info – serves a searchable list page.

/navigation – serves a navigation page with buttons leading to other sections.

Static pages like /navigation include inline or linked CSS for styling and optional frontend JS scripts for additional interactivity.

The Express server explicitly serves both /public and /resources directories for static file access.

Future strategy allows scaling by:

Adding more .ejs templates and matching .js files.

Introducing database connections for dynamic content.

Enhancing frontend with animations, transitions, and overlays.
