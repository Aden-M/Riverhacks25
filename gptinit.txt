Project Structure and Strategy

The site uses Node.js with the Express framework to serve HTTP requests.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) is used for server-side rendering of HTML templates (.ejs files).

The /public directory is exposed statically. It contains CSS and client-side JavaScript files for each page to handle frontend behavior.

A new /resources directory is used to store static assets such as images (for example, logo.png). It is also exposed as static content via Express.

Each page in the site is backed by:

An .ejs template for the HTML structure.

A corresponding .js file in /public/js/ for dynamic frontend behavior (if needed).

Main routes are:

/map – serves the map page (Leaflet.js integration).

/info – serves a searchable list page.

/navigation – serves a navigation page with buttons leading to other sections.

Static pages like /navigation include inline or linked CSS for styling and optional frontend JS scripts for additional interactivity.

The Express server explicitly serves both /public and /resources directories for static file access.

Future strategy allows scaling by:

Adding more .ejs templates and matching .js files.

Introducing database connections for dynamic content.

Enhancing frontend with animations, transitions, and overlays.

Map Page Refinement

The /map route serves a full-page map with Leaflet.js integration.

The frontend map logic is moved into /public/js/map.js.

The map initializes centered on Austin, Texas by default, with OpenStreetMap tiles and a single marker.

A separate map.ejs template under /views provides the HTML structure.

Public Sans font is loaded from Google Fonts and applied site-wide.

The header is a solid white title bar with dark text, centered at the top, fully visible over the map background.

Mobile viewport settings are included to ensure responsive behavior.

All frontend scripts (Leaflet and custom map.js) are included properly at the bottom of the body for optimal loading.
